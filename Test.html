<h1>Combining Ability Analysis for Grain Yield and its Component Traits in Aerobic Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Cultivars

Article (PDF Available) · January 2016 with 77 Reads</h1>

<p style="color:blue;">Combining ability analysis was carried out with three lines and eight testers to estimate gene action for grain yield and its component traits in aerobic rice cultivars. The gca and sca effects were significant for all the characters indicating the importance of both additive and non-additive genetic components. There was predominance of non-additive genetic components for expression of different traits in the present set of material except for days to 50% flowering and harvest index. Amongst the parental lines, APMS6A, RPBIO4918-205, HHZ12-SAL2-Y3-Y2-1 and HHZ17-Y16-Y3-Y1 were best general combiners for grain yield along with other traits. The most specific combiners for grain yield and other traits were APMS6A × HHZ12-Y4-DT1-Y3, APMS6A × HHZ12-SAL2-Y3-Y2-1 and IR79156A × RPBIO4918-205.""</p>
